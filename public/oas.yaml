        Check the current user's permissions across all collections.

        The response is an object that contains one entry for every collection with at least one permission. Each collection has entries corresponding to the actions the user is able to perform on the collection.

        The `access` property indicates the level of access the user has for an action for a collection. `"none"` means the user has no access, `"partial"` means the user has access to some items, but may not have access to all items, and `"full"` means the user has access to all items.

        Compare the current instance's schema against the schema snapshot in JSON request body and retrieve the difference. This endpoint is only available to admin users.

        Alternatively, upload a JSON or YAML schema file.

        Does not allow different Directus versions and database vendors by default. You can opt in to bypass these checks by passing the `force` query parameter.

      summary: Authenticate a Share
      description: Authenticate as a share user. Shares work by returning a token, as it is the case with the regular login endpoint. These tokens are limited to a permissions set that only allows access to the item that was shared, and any relationally linked items that that associated role has access to. This means that all regular endpoints can be used with the token returned by this endpoint.
