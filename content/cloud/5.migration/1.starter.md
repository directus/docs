Self-hosting Directus means running the Directus software on your own infrastructure, giving you full control over your data, hardware, and deployment configuration.

## Self-hosting

### Prerequisites

- Directus 11.12.0
- Postgres 13.8
- psql command (should be included with Postgres)

### Instructions

1. Restore database

With Postgres server running, restore the SQL file into database. We recommend to restore to `directus` database. To do so, first create the database if does not exist yet:

```sh
$ psql -h localhost -p 5100 -U postgres -d postgres -c "CREATE DATABASE \"directus\""
```

If you need to use maps on your Directus project, be sure to also install `postgis`:

```sh
$ psql -h localhost -p 5100 -U postgres -d directus -c "CREATE EXTENSION \"postgis\""
```

Now you can restore your project to database:

```sh
$ psql -h localhost -p 5100 -U postgres directus < example.sql
```

2. Set files to local provider

On database, files are configured to use `cloud` provider but your Directus installation will not have this configuration. In order to have them configured locally, you just need to run the following SQL script:

```sh
$ psql -h localhost -p 5100 -U postgres directus -c "UPDATE \"directus_files\" SET \"storage\" = 'local'"
```

3. Run Directus

Finally you just need to run Directus. Be sure DB_USER configuration is the same as the one who restored database, in this case `postgres`:

```env
DB_PORT=5100
DB_POOL_MAX=4
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_CLIENT=postgres
DB_DATABASE=directus
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
```
