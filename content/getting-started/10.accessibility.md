description: We are always looking for ways to make Directus Studio more accessible. Here are some of the methods we currently support.

## Keyboard Navigation

You can navigate through Directus Studio entirely with your keyboard. The Skip Menu makes it easy to jump between page sections.

### Shortcuts

- Navigation is primarily done with the `Tab` key and occasionally with the arrow keys.
- Enter your selection with the `enter` or `space` keys.
- Save with `meta` + `s`.
- Apply edits in modals/drawers/popovers with `meta` + `enter`.
- Cancel/exit modals/drawers/popovers with the `escape` key.

Special shortcuts for the TinyMCE/WYSIWYG Editor:

- `alt` + `F10` Focus/jump to toolbar
- Arrow Keys: Navigate left/right through toolbar
- `Esc`: Return to the editor content area

### Things to keep in mind

- Visual Editor is only accessible on the Directus side — not your website. So we always need to click an edit button first, then the
  overlays are accessible.
- Manual Sorting is currently not supported/accessible.
- The DateTime interface is currently not supported/accessible.
- Once focused, the code interface (Codemirror) cannot be exited using the tab key.
- The Markdown interface also doesn’t allow you to exit the field. This is because it supports tabs inside the editor’s
  text content.
