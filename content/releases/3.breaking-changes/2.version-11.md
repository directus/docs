## Version 11.14.1

#### getAsset Permissions

`getAsset` and `GET /assets/:id` now respect the `directus_files` permissions when returning file based fields.

#### OAuth, OpenID, and SAML redirects

The SSO callback URL generation and redirect validation now includes port matching to ensure redirects target the correct server.

`navbarOpen`,`sidebarOpen`, `fullScreen` states have been removed from the `appStore` store

## Version 11.14.0

#### sidebar states removed from appStore

`navbarOpen`,`sidebarOpen`, `fullScreen` states have been removed from the `appStore` store

## Version 11.13.0

#### Non-relation types remove from RELATIONAL_TYPES

`presentation` and `group` are have been removed from `RELATIONAL_TYPES`.

#### `<scope>.delete` hook

The `<scope>.delete` hook was moved before permissions checks, and as such will now trigger regardless of the user permissions. Ensure any necessary permission checks are performed prior to any data processing.

The hook will also use any keys returned in place of the original keys for any subsequent processing.

## Version 11.12.0

#### Content Versioning

Content Versioning has been further enhanced to ensure `USER_CREATED`, `USER_UPDATED`, `DATE_CREATED`, and `DATE_UPDATED` fields now represent the last actual changes, not the promotion metadata.

Additionally, if a non-existent version is requested, the API will now return a Forbidden error instead of defaulting to the main version.

## Version 11.11.0

#### Content Versioning

Content Versioning has been updated to correctly return deeply nested relational data and support all query parameters when requesting a version of an item.

Due to these changes the following breaking changes and caveats should be noted:

**Breaking Changes**

1. Relational versioned data now requires explicit field expansion to be included in the response.
2. Invalid data (e.g. Fails validation rules) will now error on query.
3. Query parameters now apply to the versioned data instead of the main record, this applies to relational data as well.

**Caveat**

1. A merged relational object combining the main and current version is now returned. Permissions and validations are accounted for during the merge process.
2. New relational records will return with an `id` of null until promoted to main.
3. Due to the use of database transactions under the hood, deadlocking may occur when querying a version of an item.
4. When using SQLite, the above mentioned database transactions will temporarily block all other requests when querying a version of an item.

## Version 11.10.1

#### Typed services for API extensions using TypeScript

The services exposed to API extensions using TypeScript are now fully typed instead of `any`, which may cause new type errors when building extensions.

Arguments of service methods are now strictly typed, which can result in type errors for broader types that would not error before:
- The ItemsService constructor now expects the collection name to be a `string` and will error on `string | undefined` (or other unions).
- Similarly, functions like `service.readOne()`/`service.readMany()` now expect `string | number` for their primary keys and will error for nullable types

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Workaround**  
  :::collapsible{name="type workarounds"}
    If you encounter type errors, you can cast the services to `any` to restore the previous behavior:

    ```ts
    export default defineHook(({ filter, action }, context) => {
      const { services, database: knex, getSchema, logger } = context;
      const { ItemsService, FieldsService } = services as any;

      ...
    });
    ```

## Version 11.10.0

#### Database-only tables are now excluded from snapshots

Snapshots now exclude tables not tracked in `directus_collections` (database-only tables).

| Source Version | Target Version | Behavior                                                   | Impact                                       |
| -------------- | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| < 11.10.0      | ≥ 11.10.0      | Database-only tables from source will be created on target | ⚠️ Tables added                              |
| ≥ 11.10.0      | < 11.10.0      | Database-only tables will be dropped from target           | 🚨 Data loss risk                            |
| ≥ 11.10.0      | ≥ 11.10.0      | Database-only tables are ignored in snapshots              | ✅ No changes                                |
| < 11.10.0      | < 11.10.0      | Database-only tables may be created or dropped             | ⚠️ Depends on the diff between source/target |

Please review your snapshot workflows to ensure these changes will not result in unexpected behaviour.

#### `NODE_ENV` is no longer replaced for API extensions

The `NODE_ENV` value for API extensions now respects its defined value, rather than being hardcoded to `production`.

## Version 11.9.0

#### SDK login function now uses a payload parameter for email and password

The SDK's `login` functions now takes a `payload` object that accepts `email`/`password` or `identifier`/`password`
property combos to support both `local` and `LDAP` provider login.

The new usage is `sdk.login({ email, password })` or `sdk.login({ identifier, password })` for LDAP instead of `sdk.login(email, password)`.

#### SDK refresh and logout functions now use an options parameter for mode and refresh_token values

The SDK's `refresh` and `logout` functions now take an `options` object that accepts the optional `mode` and
`refresh_token` values

The new usage for `refresh` is `sdk.request(refresh({ mode: "json", refresh_token }))` instead of `sdk.request(refresh('json', refresh_token))`.

### Flows with a manual trigger require authentication

User authentication is required to trigger flows with a manual trigger.
For publicly accessible flows, please use a webhook trigger instead.

## Version 11.7.0

### Officially dropped support for MySQL 5.7

[MySQL 5.7 reached end of life](https://endoflife.date/mysql) on 31 October 2023, and is no longer supported.

## Version 11.6.0

### GraphQL primary key field type changed from `String` to `ID`

GraphQL primary key field types have changed from `String` to `ID`. If you're using GraphQL queries or mutations that pass primary keys as variables, you’ll need to update those variable types from `String` to `ID` to maintain compatibility.

### `items.create` action hook receives final payload

We now pass the final payload to the `items.create` action hook, after the filter hooks and preset changes have been applied, instead of the original payload.

## Version 11.5.0

### Changed error message when a Flow condition operation fails

The error thrown when a Flow condition operation fails has been changed to `FailedValidationError`. 

Flows that check errors from Flow condition operation failures will need to be updated accordingly.

## Version 11.1.2

### New Comment Endpoints

We've introduced a dedicated `directus_comments` collection, replacing the previous system that used `directus_activity`
for comments. While new comment endpoints have been added, existing endpoints remain functional.

Comment primary keys are now UUIDs instead of numeric values, which may impact custom type checking implementations.

### SDK Comment Function Uses New Endpoints

The internal comment endpoints in the Directus SDK have been updated to reflect this change. To avoid errors, ensure
your Directus version is compatible with the latest SDK when using comment functions.

### Migrate to `CommentsService` in Extensions

Extensions using the `ActivityService` to manage comments should migrate to the new `CommentsService`.

## Version 11.1.1

### Dropped support for the SendGrid email transport option

The SendGrid abstraction for `nodemailer` is no longer supported, so we have dropped it's usage from Directus. Users of
SendGrid should update their configuration to use their SendGrid account's SMTP Relay configuration instead.

## Version 11.0.0

Directus 11 introduces policies, a new concept within access control configuration. Permissions are no longer held in
roles, but instead in policies. Policies can be attached to roles and also directly to users.

While users can still only have one direct role, roles can now also be nested within roles. A user's permissions are now
an aggregate of all policies attached directly to them, to their role, and any nested roles.

### Changes to Object Properties

Object properties have changed and moved. This should only impact users who use and rely on the users, roles, and
permissions endpoints.

#### Users

Users now have one additional property - `policies`, which is a many-to-many relationship to `policies`.

#### Roles

Roles no longer hold `admin_access`, `app_access`, `enforce_tfa`, or `ip_access`. These have been moved to `policies`.

Roles now have one additional property - `children`, which is a one-to-many relationship to `roles`.

#### Permissions

Permissions are no longer attached to a `role`. This has been changed to a `policy`.

### Requests for Missing Fields Now Fail

If you are requesting fields that do not exist anymore, your requests will throw an error. To fix this, either put
fields back into your data model or remove them from the request.

### M2A Fields Now Require Collection Name

If you are requesting Many-to-Any (M2A) fields without collection name, they will throw an error. To fix this, you need
to put the collection name you are targeting. This is true regardless of level or if using REST/GraphQL.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Migration/Mitigation**  
  :::collapsible{name="migration steps"}
    You could previously request fields in a M2A builder without specifying the collection they came from, for example:

    ```
    GET https://example.directus.app/items/example?fields=items.item.m2a_field
    ```

    This no longer works and you must specify which collection the field is located in:

    ```
    GET https://example.directus.app/items/example?fields=items.item:m2a_collection.m2a_field
    ```

    [Understand the M2A field syntax in our global query parameter page](/guides/connect/query-parameters).

### Changes for Extension Developers

#### Properties Returned from `usersStore`

The `usersStore` has a `role` object that previously contained the `admin_access`, `app_access`, and `enforce_tfa`
properties. These are now returned directly in the `user` object.

#### `preRegisterCheck` Data Structure

If you use the `preRegisterCheck` guard function in your module extension to determine whether it is shown, it now
receives a different data structure. It previously received a list of permission objects. Now, it receives the same data
returned from the new [Get Current User Permissions](/api/permissions#get-current-user-permissions)
endpoint.

### Replaced `mysql` with `mysql2`

The database client library [`mysql`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql) has been replaced with
[`mysql2`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mysql2), which is a continuation of the former. The client is used to connect
to MySQL/MariaDB databases.

If you're using MySQL/MariaDB, please note that:

- `mysql2` leads to cross-collection queries (filtering on relations) with stricter charset comparison. Therefore,
  ensure again that the value of the config option
  [`DB_CHARSET`/`DB_CHARSET_NUMBER`](/configuration/general#database) matches the charset of your tables.
- Values of type "Decimal" are now returned as a `string` instead of a `number`, which ensures that the precision is
  preserved.
