## Opening a New Feature Request

New feature requests can be opened on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.directus.io). Please add as much detail as possible. The less ambiguity around *how* a feature should work, the easier it is to review, triage, and develop a feature.

## Review Process

We read and respond to all requests that come in to our product team. Once a feature request is something we intent to implement in the future, we put it on our roadmap for further upvoting and discussion.

## Implementing Accepted Feature Requests

It's important to note that Feature Requests on our roadmap are *not* an ordered list of things that will be worked on next. Even though we strive to prioritize what's being worked on based on community feedback, it's likely that there will be times when a feature request is blocked or deprioritized by something else that's prioritized by the team. 

The implementation of accepted feature request is triaged based on a combination of popularity, team availability, timelines, scope of the feature, and overall project goals.
