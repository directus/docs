## Opening a New Feature Request

New feature requests can be opened on our [Roadmap](https://roadmap.directus.io). Please add as much detail as possible. The less ambiguity around *how* a feature should work, the easier it is to review, triage, and develop a feature.

## Review Process

We read and respond to all requests that come in to our product team. Once a feature request is something we intend to implement in the future, we put it on our roadmap for further upvoting and discussion.

## Implementing Accepted Feature Requests

Our Feature Requests roadmap shows what we're considering, not the order we'll build them. We prioritize heavily based on community feedback, but some requests may be delayed when other work takes precedence.

The implementation of accepted feature request is triaged based on a combination of popularity, team availability, timelines, scope of the feature, and overall project goals.
