The local Directus Content MCP Server provides a set of tools that allow AI assistants to interact with your Directus instance through a Node.js application. These tools enable various operations like reading collections, managing content, working with files, and more.

**Note**: The local MCP server provides more granular tools compared to the remote MCP server. For example, it has separate `read-items`, `create-item`, `update-item`, and `delete-item` tools, while the remote MCP combines these into a single `items` tool.

This guide covers the available tools in the local MCP server and how to configure them.

## Available Tools

The MCP Server provides the following tools to interact with your Directus instance:

## Disabling Tools

You can disable specific tools to restrict the capabilities of the MCP server. This is useful for limiting destructive actions or focusing the AI assistant on specific tasks.

To disable tools, add the `DISABLE_TOOLS` environment variable to your MCP server configuration:

```json
{
	"mcpServers": {
		"directus": {
			"command": "npx",
			"args": ["@directus/content-mcp@latest"],
			"env": {
				"DIRECTUS_URL": "https://your-directus-instance.com",
				"DIRECTUS_TOKEN": "your_directus_token",
				"DISABLE_TOOLS": ["delete-item", "update-field", "create-field"]
			}
		}
	}
}
```

In this example, the `delete-item`, `update-field`, and `create-field` tools are disabled, preventing the AI assistant from deleting content or modifying the data structure.

## System Prompt Tool

The `system-prompt` tool is special - it provides context to the AI assistant about its role and capabilities when working with your Directus instance. This tool is typically called at the beginning of a conversation session.

You can customize the system prompt by setting the `MCP_SYSTEM_PROMPT` environment variable:

```json
{
	"env": {
		"MCP_SYSTEM_PROMPT": "You are an assistant specialized in managing content for our marketing website."
	}
}
```

You can also disable the system prompt entirely by setting `MCP_SYSTEM_PROMPT_ENABLED` to `false`.

## Best Practices

When working with the Directus Content MCP tools:

1. Always call the `system-prompt` tool at the beginning of a session to establish context.
2. Use the `read-collections` tool to understand the data structure before performing operations.
3. Keep destructive tools disabled in production environments to prevent accidental data loss.
