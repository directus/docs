AI Chat is designed with security in mind. This page covers how access is controlled and what to consider when using AI with your data.

## Access Control

![Access control flow](https://placehold.co/700x300/1E1E32/FFFFFF?text=Auth+→+Data+Studio+→+Permissions)

AI Chat requires authentication and Data Studio access. Unauthenticated users, API-only users, and public roles cannot access it.

The AI operates with your existing Directus permissions - if you can't access a collection or delete items, neither can the AI. This differs from the [MCP Server](/guides/ai/mcp), which uses separate access tokens.

## Data Protection

**API Keys:** Encrypted at rest in the database and masked in the UI. Only administrators can configure them.

**Conversations:** Stored in your browser only (localStorage). Not saved to the server, not shared between devices. See [Data Storage](/guides/ai/chat/usage#data-storage).

## Data Sent to AI Providers

Your messages, schema information, item data, and tool responses are sent to the configured provider (OpenAI or Anthropic).

**Review provider privacy policies:**
- [OpenAI Privacy Policy](https://openai.com/policies/privacy-policy) | [API Data Usage](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/how-we-use-your-data)
- [Anthropic Privacy Policy](https://www.anthropic.com/privacy)

**Be mindful of what you discuss.** Avoid sharing sensitive personal data, credentials, or confidential information in AI conversations.

## Tool Approvals

All tools require approval by default. Configure per-tool settings in the chat header menu. See [Tool Behavior](/guides/ai/chat/tools#tool-behavior) for details.

## Best Practices

1. **Review tool calls** before approving, especially writes and deletes
2. **Use appropriate roles** - don't give users more permissions than needed
3. **Test in development** before using AI Chat with production data
4. **Be selective** about what data you discuss with AI
