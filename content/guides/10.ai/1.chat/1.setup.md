AI Chat requires an API key from an supported AI provider. This page covers the administrator setup process.

## Requirements

- Administrator access to your Directus instance
- API key from OpenAI or Anthropic (see below)
- Users must have **App access** - Public (non-authenticated) or API-only users cannot use AI Chat

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info" color="info"}
Note that all users of AI Chat will share a single API key from your configured provider. Usage limits and costs will be shared across all users. See your provider's dashboard for monitoring usage details and costs.
::

## Get an API Key

You'll need an API key from at least one provider. Choose based on which models you want to use.

::accordion{type="single"}

:::accordion-item{label="OpenAI" icon="i-simple-icons-openai"}

OpenAI provides GPT-5 models (Nano, Mini, Standard).

1. Go to [platform.openai.com](https://platform.openai.com/) and sign in or create an account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the left sidebar (or go directly to [platform.openai.com/api-keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))
3. Click **Create new secret key**
4. Give it a name like "Directus AI Chat"
5. Copy the key immediately - you won't be able to see it again

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info" color="info"}
OpenAI requires a payment method and has usage-based pricing. Set spending limits in **Settings → Limits** to control costs.

:::

:::accordion-item{label="Anthropic" icon="i-simple-icons-anthropic"}

Anthropic provides Claude models (Haiku 4.5, Sonnet 4.5).

1. Go to [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com/) and sign in or create an account
2. Navigate to **API Keys** in the settings
3. Click **Create Key**
4. Give it a name like "Directus AI Chat"
5. Copy the key immediately

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info" color="info"}

## Configure API Keys in Directus

::steps{level="3"}

### Navigate to AI Settings

Go to **Settings → AI** in the Directus admin panel.

![AI Settings page in Directus](/img/ai-chat-settings-disabled.png)

### Enter Your API Key

Add your API key for one or both providers:

- **OpenAI API Key** - Enables GPT-5 models
- **Anthropic API Key** - Enables Claude models

::callout{icon="material-symbols:security" color="info"}
API keys are encrypted at rest in the database and masked in the UI.
::

### Save Settings

Click **Save** to apply your changes. AI Chat is now available to all users with [App access](/guides/auth/access-control#studio-users).

::

## Custom System Prompt

Optionally customize how the AI assistant behaves in **Settings → AI → Custom System Prompt**.

The [default system prompt](https://github.com/directus/directus/blob/main/api/src/ai/chat/constants/system-prompt.ts) provides the AI with helpful instructions on how to interact with Directus and is tuned to provide good results.

If you choose to customize the system prompt, it's recommended to use the following template as a starting point:

::accordion{type="single"}

:::accordion-item{label="View Default System Prompt" icon="material-symbols:code"}

```xml
<behavior_instructions>
You are **Directus Assistant**, a Directus CMS expert with access to a Directus instance through specialized tools

## Communication Style

- **Be concise**: Users prefer short, direct responses. One-line confirmations: "Created collection 'products'"
- **Match the audience**: Technical for developers, plain language for content editors
- **NEVER guess**: If not at least 99% about field values or user intent, ask for clarification

## Tool Usage Patterns

### Discovery First

1. Understand the user's task and what they need to achieve.
2. Discover schema if needed for task - **schema()** with no params → lightweight collection list or **schema({ keys: ["products", "categories"] })** → full field/relation details
3. Use other tools as needed to achieve the user's task.

### Content Items

- Use `fields` whenever possible to fetch only the exact fields you need
- Use `filter` and `limit` to control the number of fetched items unless you absolutely need larger datasets
- When presenting repeated structured data with 4+ items, use markdown tables for better readability

### Schema & Data Changes

- **Confirm before modifying any schema**: Collections, fields, relations always need approval from the user.
- **Check namespace conflicts**: Collection folders and regular collections share namespace. Collection folders are distinct from file folders.

### Safety Rules

- **Deletions require confirmation**: ALWAYS ask before deleting anything
- **Warn on bulk operations**: Alert when affecting many items ("This updates 500 items")
- **Avoid duplicates**: Never create duplicates if you can't modify existing items
- **Use semantic HTML**: No classes, IDs, or inline styles in content fields (unless explicitly asked for by the user)
- **Permission errors**: Report immediately, don't retry

### Behavior Rules

- Call tools immediately without explanatory text
- Use parallel tool calls when possible
- If you don't have access to a certain tool, ask the user to grant you access to the tool from the chat settings.
- If there are unused tools in context but task is simple, suggest disabling unused tools (once per conversation)

## Error Handling

- Auto-retry once for clear errors ("field X required")
- Stop after 2 failures, consult user
- If tool unavailable, suggest enabling in chat settings

## Managing Costs

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning" color="warning"}
**AI Chat uses your own AI provider API keys.** Every message and tool call costs money. Be mindful of usage, especially with larger models. You are responsible for the costs of your usage.
::

**Tips for controlling costs:**
- Use faster, cheaper models (GPT-5 Nano, Claude Haiku 4.5) for simple tasks
- Disable unused tools - disabled tools are not loaded into context, reducing token usage
- Set spending limits in your [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/limits) or [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/) dashboard
