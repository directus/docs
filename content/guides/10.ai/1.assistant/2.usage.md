Click the AI Assistant button in the Directus right sidebar to open the chat panel. The panel appears on the right side of your screen and persists as you navigate.

## Selecting a Model

![Model selector dropdown](/img/ai-chat-model-selector-cropped.png)

Click the model dropdown in the chat header to choose which AI model to use:

| Model | Best For |
|-------|----------|
| :icon{name="logos:openai-icon"} GPT-5 Nano / :icon{name="logos:claude-icon"} Claude Haiku 4.5 / :icon{name="i-simple-icons-googlegemini"} Gemini 3 Flash Preview | Quick tasks, simple queries |
| :icon{name="logos:openai-icon"} GPT-5 Mini | Balanced speed and capability |
| :icon{name="logos:openai-icon"} GPT-5 / :icon{name="logos:claude-icon"} Claude Sonnet 4.5 / :icon{name="i-simple-icons-googlegemini"} Gemini 3 Pro Preview | Complex operations, detailed analysis |

Only models for [configured providers](/guides/ai/assistant/setup) appear in the dropdown.

## Having a Conversation

Type your message and press **Enter** to send (**Shift+Enter** for new line). Responses stream in real-time with full Markdown formatting.

## Understanding Responses

AI Assistant displays several types of content in responses:

### Text Messages

Standard conversational responses with Markdown formatting.

### Reasoning Blocks

![Reasoning block showing AI's internal thinking](/img/ai-chat-reasoning-cropped.png)

Collapsible sections showing the AI's internal reasoning (extended thinking). Click to expand.

### Tool Calls

![Completed tool call showing results](/img/ai-chat-tool-call-complete-cropped.png)

When the AI performs an action, it displays a tool call card showing:
- The tool being used
- Input parameters
- Results after execution

## Tool Approval

All tools require approval by default. When a tool needs approval, review the action then choose **Approve**, **Deny** (Esc), or **Always Allow**.

![Tool approval dialog showing approve, deny, and always allow options](/img/ai-chat-tool-approval-requested-cropped.png)

Configure per-tool approval settings via the gear icon in the chat header. See [Tool Behavior](/guides/ai/assistant/tools#tool-behavior) for details.

## Managing Conversations

### Clearing the Conversation

![Clear conversation button in chat header](/img/ai-chat-clear-conversation-cropped.png)

Click the clear button (trash icon) in the chat header to start fresh. This resets:
- Message history
- Token usage tracking

### Stopping a Response

While the AI is generating a response, the send button becomes a stop button. Click it to interrupt generation.

### Retrying After an Error

If an error occurs, a retry button appears. Click to regenerate the last response.

## Context Limits

::callout{icon="material-symbols:lightbulb" color="primary"}
Start a new conversation when switching topics. The AI performs better with focused, single-topic conversations. Long conversations may have older messages dropped automatically.

## Data Storage

### What's Stored in Your Browser

- Conversation history
- Selected model preference
- Tool approval settings
- Chat open/closed state

### What's NOT Stored

- Conversations are **not saved to the Directus server**
- Conversations are **not shared** between users or devices
- Closing the browser or clearing local storage deletes history

## Permissions

The AI operates with your existing [Directus permissions](/guides/auth/access-control). If you don't have access to a collection or operation, neither does the AI. See [Security](/guides/ai/assistant/security) for more details.
