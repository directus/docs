Follow these tips to work effectively with AI Assistant and get better results from your conversations.

## Be Specific About Collections and Fields

The more specific you are, the better results you'll get.

**Less effective:**
> "Add a new post"

**More effective:**
> "Create a new article in the articles collection with title 'Getting Started with Directus', status 'draft', and assign it to the 'Tutorials' category"

## Complex Tasks

Break complex requests into smaller, more manageable steps:

1. "First, show me all products without descriptions"
2. "Now update product X with this description: ..."
3. "Next, do the same for product Y..."
4. "Finally, verify the products were updated correctly"

## Start Fresh for New Topics

Long conversations can lose context. When switching to a different task, clear the conversation and start fresh.

**Signs you should start a new conversation:**
- The AI seems confused about your schema
- Responses are becoming less relevant
- You're working on an unrelated task

## Configure Tool Approvals

- Read-only tools like Schema can safely be set to :icon{name="material-symbols:check" class="text-success"} **Always Allowed**
- Keep write operations on :icon{name="material-symbols:approval-delegation" class="text-warning"} **Needs Approval** until you're confident
- :icon{name="material-symbols:block" class="text-error"} **Disable** tools you don't need to reduce token usage

See [Tool Behavior](/guides/ai/assistant/tools#tool-behavior) for more details.

## Use Context Effectively

Context attachments help the AI understand what you're working with. See [Adding Context](/guides/ai/assistant/usage#adding-context) for setup details.

**When to attach context:**
- Asking about or modifying specific items
- Comparing or batch-processing content
- Making AI-assisted edits in the Visual Editor
- Using prompts to maintain consistent formatting

**Keep in mind:**
- Maximum 10 context items per message
- Context is captured as a snapshot when sent
- Large items increase token usage

**Visual Editor tips:**
- Add multiple elements as context before sending a message
- Hover context cards to verify you've selected the right elements
- Add elements from different pages—context persists while navigating

### Context Example Prompts

**With Prompts attached:**

```
Use the "Brand Voice" prompt to write a product announcement
```

```
Apply the "SEO Description" template to this page
```

**With Items attached:**

```
Compare these two products and highlight the differences
```

```
Update this article to match the tone of the attached reference
```

**With Visual Elements attached:**

```
Translate this section to French
```

```
Make this paragraph more concise while keeping the key points
```

```
Rewrite this heading to be more engaging
```

## Manage Costs

AI Assistant requires API keys from OpenAI or Anthropic — you cannot use a ChatGPT Plus or Claude Pro subscription. API access is billed per token, so costs scale with usage. Be mindful of this, especially with larger models.

**Disable tools you don't use.** Disabled tools are not loaded into context, reducing token usage and API costs. If you only work with content, disable schema modification tools.

## Common Gotchas

### Permissions Apply

The AI operates with your user permissions. If you're receiving permissions errors in AI Assistant, it's likely the user account doesn't have the necessary permissions to perform the action.

### Deletions Require Extra Care

The AI is instructed to ask for confirmation before deleting items. However, LLMs don't always follow instructions perfectly — keep destructive tools on "Ask" approval mode if you want guaranteed confirmation before deletions.

### Related Data May Be Affected

When deleting items that have relationships, consider cascade behavior:
- Deleting an author may affect related articles
- Deleting a category may orphan products

The LLM may not always warn you about potential impacts.

## When AI Assistant Works Best

**Great for:**
- Exploring and understanding your schema
- Quick content operations (create, update, query)
- Setting up new collections and fields
- Triggering manual flows

**Consider other approaches for:**
- Very large bulk operations (use direct API or import / export through the Data Studio)
- Complex data migrations (use scripts or dedicated tools)
- Sensitive operations on production data (test in staging first)
