AI assistants can now directly access your Directus content using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP). Instead of copying data back and forth, your AI tools connect directly to your Directus instance.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info" color="info"}
**MCP is currently in Beta and requires Directus v11.12 +**. For older versions, use the [Local MCP alternative](/guides/ai/mcp/local-mcp).
::

## Is this for you?

- **Content editors**: Migrate content from Google Docs, organize individual files, and manage content with AI assistance.
- **Developers**: Rapidly prototype data models, create collections, and build automation workflows.
- **Teams**: Dramatically speed up content operations while maintaining brand consistency.

## What you can do with the Directus MCP Server?

### For Content Editors

**Use LLMs and AI to create and manage content.**


- Import blog posts from Google Docs with proper field mapping
- Build landing pages using page builder components and relationships
- Add metadata to individual images (alt text, descriptions, tags)
- Organize files into logical folder structures
- Create content entries with proper relationships to authors, categories, etc.


### For Developers
**Rapidly prototype data models and build automation using natural language.**


- Create collections with proper field types and validation rules
- Set up complex relationships (M2O, O2M, M2M, M2A) between collections
- Generate automation flows triggered by database events
- Build approval workflows with custom operations
- Prototype entire data models through conversation

---

## How it works

1. Enable MCP in Directus Settings → AI
2. Create access token for your MCP user (we recommend creating a dedicated user for MCP operations)
3. Connect your AI tool to the Directus MCP server
4. Use AI to create, edit, and manage your content

Your AI assistant operates through your existing Directus permissions - no middleware or data copying required.

## Security built-in

- Uses your existing Directus permissions
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Global delete protection (disabled by default)

messages:
  - role: user
    content: "I have this blog post in Google Docs about AI trends in 2024. Can you import it as a new article in my blog collection?"
  - role: assistant
    content: "I'll help you import that article. Let me first check your blog collection structure to understand the available fields... I can see you have fields for title, content, author, category, tags, and published_date. Please share the Google Doc content and I'll create a properly formatted blog post entry with the correct relationships."
  - role: user
    content: "[shares Google Doc content]"
  - role: assistant
    content: "Perfect! I've created a new blog post with:\n\n- ✅ **Title**: \"AI Trends Shaping 2024: A Comprehensive Overview\"\n- ✅ **Content**: Properly formatted with headings and paragraphs\n- ✅ **Author**: Linked to your user profile\n- ✅ **Category**: Set to \"Technology\"\n- ✅ **Tags**: Added \"AI\", \"trends\", \"2024\", \"technology\"\n- ✅ **Status**: Set to \"draft\" for your review\n\nThe article is now available at: `/admin/content/blog/123`\n\nWould you like me to make any adjustments or set it to published status?"

messages:
  - role: user
    content: "I just uploaded a product photo but forgot to add alt text. Can you analyze this image and add proper metadata?"
  - role: assistant
    content: "I'll analyze the image and add appropriate metadata. Let me first retrieve the image using the assets tool...\n\nI can see it's a photo of a red leather handbag with gold hardware on a white background. I'll update the file with:\n\n- ✅ **Title**: \"Red Leather Handbag with Gold Hardware\"\n- ✅ **Alt Text**: \"Red leather handbag with gold chain strap and hardware on white background\"\n- ✅ **Description**: \"Premium red leather handbag featuring gold-tone hardware and adjustable chain strap, photographed on clean white background for product catalog\"\n- ✅ **Tags**: Added \"handbag\", \"leather\", \"red\", \"gold-hardware\", \"product-photo\"\n\nThe file metadata has been updated. Would you like me to organize it into a specific folder as well?"

messages:
  - role: user
    content: "I need to set up a product catalog with variants and categories. Can you help me design this?"
  - role: assistant
    content: "I'll help you create a comprehensive product catalog structure. Let me design this with proper relationships:\n\n**Collections I'll create:**\n1. **Products** - Main product information\n2. **Categories** - Product categories\n3. **Variants** - Size, color, style options\n4. **Product_Variants** - Junction table for M2M relationship\n\nShould I proceed with creating these collections and their relationships?"
  - role: user
    content: "Yes, that sounds perfect!"
  - role: assistant
    content: "Great! I've successfully created your product catalog structure:\n\n#### ✅ Products Collection\n- `name`, `description`, `price`, `sku`, `featured_image`\n- M2O relationship to Categories\n\n#### ✅ Categories Collection  \n- `name`, `slug`, `description`, `parent_category` (self-referencing)\n\n#### ✅ Variants Collection\n- `type` (color/size/style), `name`, `value`\n\n#### ✅ Product_Variants Junction Table\n- M2M relationship connecting Products ↔ Variants\n- Additional fields: `price_modifier`, `stock_quantity`\n\nAll collections are ready! You can now start adding products with multiple variants and organize them into categories. Would you like me to create some sample data to get you started?"
