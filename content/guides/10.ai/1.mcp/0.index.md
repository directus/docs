AI assistants can now directly access your Directus content using the [Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) (MCP). Instead of copying data back and forth, your AI tools connect directly to your Directus instance.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info" color="info"}
**MCP is currently in Beta and requires Directus v11.12 +**. For older versions, use the [Local MCP alternative](/guides/ai/mcp/local-mcp).
::

## Is this for you?

- **Content editors**: Migrate content from Google Docs, organize individual files, and manage content with AI assistance.
- **Developers**: Rapidly prototype data models, create collections, and build automation workflows.
- **Teams**: Dramatically speed up content operations while maintaining brand consistency.

## What you can do with the Directus MCP Server?

### For Content Editors

**Use LLMs and AI to create and manage content.**


- Import blog posts from Google Docs with proper field mapping
- Build landing pages using page builder components and relationships
- Add metadata to individual images (alt text, descriptions, tags)
- Organize files into logical folder structures
- Create content entries with proper relationships to authors, categories, etc.


### For Developers
**Rapidly prototype data models and build automation using natural language.**


- Create collections with proper field types and validation rules
- Set up complex relationships (M2O, O2M, M2M, M2A) between collections
- Generate automation flows triggered by database events
- Build approval workflows with custom operations
- Prototype entire data models through conversation

---

## How it works

1. Enable MCP in Directus Settings → AI
2. Create access token for your MCP user (we recommend creating a dedicated user for MCP operations)
3. Connect your AI tool to the Directus MCP server
4. Use AI to create, edit, and manage your content

Your AI assistant operates through your existing Directus permissions - no middleware or data copying required.

---

## Security built-in

- Uses your existing Directus permissions
- Complete audit trail of all changes
- Global delete protection (disabled by default)
