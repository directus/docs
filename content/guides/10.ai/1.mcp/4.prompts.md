Prompts let you save useful AI instructions in Directus so you can reuse them instead of typing the same thing over and over.

**Client Support**: Not all AI clients support prompts. Check the [MCP clients compatibility matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for your specific client.

## Setting Up Prompts

Before you can create reusable prompts and use them in your AI conversations, you need to set up a collection to store them.

### Create or Configure the Collection

1. Go to **Settings → AI → Model Context Protocol**.
2. Find **AI Prompts Collection**.
   ![AI Prompts Collection](/img/mcp-settings-page-prompts-collection.png)
3. You have two options:

    **Option 1: Generate New Collection**
    - Click **"Generate AI Prompts collection..."**
    - This creates a new collection with all the right fields automatically.

    **Option 2: Use Existing Collection**
    - Select an existing collection from the dropdown.
    - Directus will validate the collection and prompt you to create any missing fields needed for prompts.
    - If you approve, Directus will create the required fields for you
    - Useful if you already have an AI prompts collection or want to use a different collection name.

**Don't forget to set permissions**: Make sure your MCP user can read (and optionally create/update) prompts in their role permissions. See [Access Control](/guides/auth/access-control) for more information.

## Creating Prompts

### Simple Example

Create a new item in your prompts collection:

**Name**:

`blog-post`

**Description**:

`Write a blog post on any topic`

**System Prompt**:

```
You're a blogger writing for a tech-savvy audience. Keep it conversational but informative.
```

**Messages**:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Write a blog post about {{topic}}. Make it about {{length}} words."
  }
]
```

### Using Variables

The `{{topic}}` and `{{length}}` are placeholders. When you use the prompt, you'll fill those in:

> "Use the blog-post prompt. Topic is 'AI in small business' and length is 800 words."

### More Complex Example

For something more structured:

**Name**:

`product-description`

**Messages**:

```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Write a product description for {{product_name}}. It's a {{category}} that {{main_benefit}}. Price is {{price}}. Target audience: {{audience}}."
  }
]
```

Usage:
> "Use product-description prompt. Product name is 'Smart Garden Sensor', category is 'IoT device', main benefit is 'monitors soil moisture automatically', price is '$49', audience is 'home gardeners'."
