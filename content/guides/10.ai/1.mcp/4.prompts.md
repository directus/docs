Prompts let you save useful AI instructions in Directus so you can reuse them instead of typing the same thing over and over.

**Client Support**: Not all AI clients support prompts yet. Claude Desktop and Claude Code do, but check the [MCP clients compatibility matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for your specific client.

## Setting Up Prompts

### Create the Collection

1. Go to **Settings → AI → Model Context Protocol**
2. Find **AI Prompts Collection**
3. Click **"Generate AI Prompts collection..."** 

This creates a collection with all the right fields automatically. Much easier than building it yourself.

### Set Permissions

Make sure your MCP user can read (and optionally create/update) prompts in their role permissions.

## Creating Prompts

### Simple Example

Create a new item in your prompts collection:

**Name**: `blog-post`  
**Description**: `Write a blog post on any topic`  
**System Prompt**:
```
You're a blogger writing for a tech-savvy audience. Keep it conversational but informative.
```
**Messages**:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user", 
    "content": "Write a blog post about {{topic}}. Make it about {{length}} words."
  }
]
```

### Using Variables

The `{{topic}}` and `{{length}}` are placeholders. When you use the prompt, you'll fill those in:

> "Use the blog-post prompt. Topic is 'AI in small business' and length is 800 words."

### More Complex Example

For something more structured:

**Name**: `product-description`  
**Messages**:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Write a product description for {{product_name}}. It's a {{category}} that {{main_benefit}}. Price is {{price}}. Target audience: {{audience}}."
  }
]
```

Usage:
> "Use product-description prompt. Product name is 'Smart Garden Sensor', category is 'IoT device', main benefit is 'monitors soil moisture automatically', price is '$49', audience is 'home gardeners'."

## Using Prompts

### See What's Available

> "What prompts do I have?"

The AI will list all your saved prompts.

### Run a Prompt

> "Use the [prompt-name] prompt with [your variables]"

The AI finds the prompt, plugs in your variables, and runs it.

### Let AI Create Prompts

> "Create a prompt for writing product reviews that asks for the product name, pros, cons, and rating"

The AI will create the prompt and save it to your collection.

## Useful Prompt Ideas

**Content Creation**:
- `social-media-post` - Generate posts for different platforms
- `email-newsletter` - Consistent newsletter format
- `press-release` - Standard PR template

**Documentation**:
- `api-endpoint` - Document API endpoints consistently
- `user-guide` - Step-by-step instructions format
- `changelog` - Standard format for release notes

**E-commerce**:
- `product-description` - Structured product info
- `category-description` - SEO-friendly category pages
- `size-guide` - Helpful sizing information

**Support**:
- `help-article` - FAQ-style help content
- `troubleshooting` - Step-by-step problem solving
- `feature-explanation` - How features work

## Tips

**Keep it simple**: Start with basic prompts before getting fancy with multi-message conversations.

**Test your variables**: Try your prompts with different inputs to make sure they work reliably.

**Be specific**: "Write a blog post" is vague. "Write a 500-word blog post with an intro, 3 main points, and a conclusion" is better.

**Version your prompts**: Create `email-formal` and `email-casual` instead of trying to make one prompt do everything.

**Share with your team**: Good prompts are worth sharing. Everyone can use the same collection.

## Common Issues

**Prompts not showing up**: Check that your MCP user has read permissions on the prompts collection.

**Variables not working**: Make sure you're using the exact variable name from the prompt, including spelling and case.

**AI ignoring the prompt**: Some prompts are just suggestions. If the AI isn't following it exactly, try making the instructions more specific.

**Client doesn't support prompts**: Not all MCP clients have prompt support yet. You can still copy/paste from your prompts collection manually.

Think of prompts as templates that save you from retyping the same instructions. They're especially useful when multiple people need to generate similar content or when you've figured out a good way to phrase something.
