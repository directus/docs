Prompts let you save useful AI instructions in Directus so you can reuse them instead of typing the same thing over and over.

**Client Support**: Not all AI clients support prompts. Check the [MCP clients compatibility matrix](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/clients) for your specific client.

## Setting Up Prompts

### Create or Configure the Collection

1. Go to **Settings → AI → Model Context Protocol**
2. Find **AI Prompts Collection**
3. You have two options:

**Option 1: Generate New Collection**
- Click **"Generate AI Prompts collection..."**
- This creates a new collection with all the right fields automatically

**Option 2: Use Existing Collection**
- Select an existing collection from the dropdown
- Directus will automatically create any missing fields needed for prompts
- Useful if you already have an AI prompts collection or want to use a different collection name

### Set Permissions

Make sure your MCP user can read (and optionally create/update) prompts in their role permissions.

## Creating Prompts

### Simple Example

Create a new item in your prompts collection:

**Name**: `blog-post`
**Description**: `Write a blog post on any topic`
**System Prompt**:
```
You're a blogger writing for a tech-savvy audience. Keep it conversational but informative.
```
**Messages**:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Write a blog post about {{topic}}. Make it about {{length}} words."
  }
]
```

### Using Variables

The `{{topic}}` and `{{length}}` are placeholders. When you use the prompt, you'll fill those in:

> "Use the blog-post prompt. Topic is 'AI in small business' and length is 800 words."

### More Complex Example

For something more structured:

**Name**: `product-description`
**Messages**:
```json
[
  {
    "role": "user",
    "content": "Write a product description for {{product_name}}. It's a {{category}} that {{main_benefit}}. Price is {{price}}. Target audience: {{audience}}."
  }
]
```

Usage:
> "Use product-description prompt. Product name is 'Smart Garden Sensor', category is 'IoT device', main benefit is 'monitors soil moisture automatically', price is '$49', audience is 'home gardeners'."

## Using Prompts

### See What's Available

> "What prompts do I have?"

The AI will list all your saved prompts.

### Run a Prompt

> "Use the [prompt-name] prompt with [your variables]"

The AI finds the prompt, plugs in your variables, and runs it.

### Let AI Create Prompts

> "Create a prompt for writing product reviews that asks for the product name, pros, cons, and rating"

The AI will create the prompt and save it to your collection.
