## From Document to Directus

One of the most frustrating content workflows involves transferring content from documents (like Google Docs) into a CMS. Issues with formatting, structure, and metadata make this process time-consuming and error-prone.

**With the MCP server, you can:**

1. Share a document link or content with the AI.
2. Have it automatically create a properly formatted entry in Directus.
3. All fields are populated correctly without manual copying and pasting.
4. Preview immediately and make any necessary adjustments.

```
User: "Can you please import this product specification document as a new product entry in my catalog collection?"
Assistant: [Extracts content, creates properly formatted entry, and provides confirmation]
```

## Asset Selection and Management

Finding appropriate images for content often requires searching through numerous assets or external sources.

**The MCP workflow simplifies this:**

1. Ask the AI to search your Directus assets for relevant images.
2. The AI can analyze image content and metadata to find appropriate matches.
3. Selected images can be automatically added to your content.
4. Save time browsing through asset libraries manually.

```
User: "Find images in our asset library related to customer support for our new help center article."
Assistant: [Searches assets, suggests options, and can apply the selected image]
```

## Asset Analysis and Organization

Asset libraries in CMS platforms often accumulate files with generic filenames and minimal metadata over time. This common workflow challenge makes finding the right assets difficult and slows down content creation.

**Transform your asset management with AI:**

1. Depending on the model used, your AI tools can analyze image content to understand what each image contains.
2. Generate descriptive titles and metadata based on visual analysis.
3. Suggest appropriate tags and categories for better organization.
4. Bulk update multiple assets with proper descriptions and metadata.

```
User: "Analyze all images in our product photography folder and add proper titles and descriptions based on what you see."
Assistant: [Reviews images, identifies products/scenes, and updates metadata with descriptive information]
```

**Example improvements:**
- `IMG_2847.jpg` becomes `Red leather handbag with gold hardware on white background`
- Missing alt text gets populated with `Professional product photo of red handbag for e-commerce`
- Tags automatically added: `handbag`, `leather`, `red`, `product-photo`, `accessories`

## Content Enhancement

Content may need adjustments to match your brand voice or target a specific audience segment.

**Create a more collaborative workflow:**

1. Store custom prompts in your Directus instance for specific content needs.
2. Use the MCP server to access these prompts and apply them to content.
3. Transform generic content into text that matches your voice and style.
4. Maintain brand consistency across all content.

```
User: "Rewrite this product description to be more engaging for a young adult audience."
Assistant: [Applies stored prompt rules to transform the content while preserving key information]
```

## Automated Page Creation

Creating structured pages typically requires understanding your website's component structure and content patterns.

**Streamline with MCP:**

1. The AI can analyze your existing page structure in Directus.
2. Provide key information about the new page's purpose and content.
3. Have the AI create a complete page with appropriate components.
4. Review and refine using the visual editor.

```
User: "Create a new event page for our upcoming conference using our standard event page structure."
Assistant: [Creates components, populates content, and builds complete page structure]
```

## Content Migration

Moving content between systems or reformatting legacy content can be tedious.

**Leverage AI assistance:**

1. Share source content with the AI.
2. Specify the destination format and structure needed in Directus.
3. The AI handles the transformation and proper field mapping.
4. Eliminate hours of manual reformatting.

```
User: "Convert this spreadsheet of customer testimonials into properly formatted entries in our testimonials collection."
Assistant: [Analyzes structure needs and creates properly formatted content]
```
