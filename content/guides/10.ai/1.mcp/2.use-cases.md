Here are some practical ways people are using AI with Directus to speed up their content workflows.

## Content Creation

### Import from Google Docs

Instead of copying and pasting blog posts from Google Docs (and losing all your formatting), just tell the AI:

> "Import this blog post from Google Docs into my articles collection"

The AI will create a properly structured entry with the right field types, categories, and author relationships.

### Update Content in Batches

Need to publish 20 draft posts at once? Or add tags to a bunch of articles?

> "Set all blog posts tagged 'product updates' to published status"

> "Add alt text to all product photos that don't have any"

Much faster than clicking through each item individually.

### Content from External Sources

Got a press release or competitor analysis you want to turn into structured content?

> "Turn this press release into a news item in my press collection, and create related company and person entries"

The AI understands your schema and creates everything with proper relationships.

## Asset Management

### Fix Your Image Library

We've all been there - hundreds of images named `IMG_2847.jpg` with no descriptions. The AI can analyze and organize them:

> "Go through my product photos and give them proper names, descriptions, and organize them into folders"

**Before**: `IMG_2847.jpg`
**After**: `red-leather-handbag-gold-hardware.jpg` with proper alt text and organized into `/products/handbags/`

### Bulk Metadata Updates

> "Add alt text to all images that don't have any"

> "Create thumbnails and organize all uploaded PDFs from this month"

## Schema Changes

### Add Fields and Populate Them

When you realize you need a new field across existing content:

> "Add a 'featured_image' field to my blog posts and populate it with the first image from each post's content"

> "Create a 'reading_time' field and calculate it for all existing articles"

The AI handles both the schema change and the data migration.

### Set Up Relationships

Complex relationships are annoying to set up manually:

> "Create a tagging system for my products - I need a tags collection and a many-to-many relationship"

> "Set up categories for my blog with a parent-child hierarchy"

## Real Workflow Examples

### E-commerce Product Import

**The old way**: Download CSV, manually map fields, fix formatting issues, upload images separately, create relationships one by one.

**With AI**:
> "Import these 50 products from this CSV, create the product entries, upload and link the images from the provided URLs, and set up categories"

### Event Management

**The old way**: Create event, manually add each speaker, create session entries, link everything together.

**With AI**:
> "Create an event called 'Tech Conference 2024' with these 10 speakers and their sessions from this agenda"

### Content Migration

**The old way**: Export from old CMS, massage data, import piece by piece, recreate relationships.

**With AI**:
> "Migrate all these blog posts from WordPress, keeping the categories and author relationships intact"

## Automation with Flows

You can trigger Directus Flows with AI:

> "Run the content audit flow on all blog posts from last month"

> "Trigger the email sequence for all users who signed up this week"

This is great for one-off maintenance tasks or testing automation.

## Tips for Success

**Start simple**: Try basic operations like publishing posts or updating metadata before complex schema changes.

**Use staging**: Test workflows on development data first, especially for bulk operations.

**Review everything**: The AI is good but not perfect. Always check important changes.

**Permissions matter**: The AI can only do what your user account can do, which is actually a good safety feature.

**Keep backups**: Before big bulk operations, make sure you have recent backups.

## Common Gotchas

**File uploads**: The AI can't upload files directly from your computer, but it can work with URLs or files already in Directus.

**Complex validation**: If you have strict validation rules, the AI might create entries that don't pass validation.

**Rate limits**: For huge bulk operations, you might hit API rate limits.

**Relationships**: The AI needs existing entries to create relationships - it can't link to entries that don't exist yet.

The key is treating AI as a smart assistant, not a magic wand. It's really good at the tedious, repetitive stuff that normally takes forever to do manually.
