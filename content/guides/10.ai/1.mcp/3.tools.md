---

The Directus remote MCP server provides a set of tools that allow AI assistants to interact with your Directus instance. These tools enable various operations while respecting your existing permissions and security settings.

**Note**: The remote MCP server uses unified tools compared to the local MCP server. For example, it has a single `items` tool that handles all CRUD operations, while the local MCP has separate `read-items`, `create-item`, `update-item`, and `delete-item` tools.

## Available Tools

The remote MCP server provides the following tools:

| Tool | Description | Use Cases |
|------|-------------|-----------|
| **system-prompt** | Provides context about Directus and your instance | Start of session, understanding capabilities |
| **items** | Complete CRUD operations on collection items | Content management, data operations |
| **schema** | Read collection and field schema information | Understanding data structure, exploring collections |
| **collections** | Manage Directus collections (database tables) | Creating/modifying collections, database structure |
| **fields** | Manage collection fields and their configuration | Adding/modifying fields, changing data types |
| **relations** | Create and manage relationships between collections | Setting up relationships, data modeling |
| **files** | File management and metadata operations | Managing uploads, organizing media |
| **assets** | Retrieve file content as base64 for AI processing | Image analysis, content processing |
| **flows** | Automation workflow management | Creating automations, workflow design |
| **operations** | Manage individual operations within flows | Building automation logic, flow operations |
| **trigger-flow** | Execute manual flows programmatically | Running automations, bulk operations |
| **folders** | Manage file organization structure | Organizing files, creating folder structures |

## System Prompt Tool

The `system-prompt` tool provides the AI assistant with specialized knowledge about Directus and your instance configuration. It should typically be called at the beginning of each session.

This tool works like a system prompt for LLMs, but it's delivered as a tool call instead of being built into the conversation. The AI is instructed to call this tool first to load Directus-specific knowledge into the conversation context. It won't override any system prompts or instructions from your MCP client.

**View the current system prompt** on GitHub to see exactly what instructions the AI receives about working with Directus.

You can customize the system prompt or disable it entirely in **Settings → AI → Model Context Protocol**.

## Best Practices

When working with the Directus MCP server tools:

1. **Reference your Directus instance**: Mention `my Directus instance` or `my Directus project` to help the AI understand it should use tools.
2. **AI handles context automatically**: The AI should call system prompt and schema tools as needed based on your requests.
3. **Use scoped permissions**: Create dedicated MCP users with minimal required permissions.
4. **Test in development**: Try operations in a development environment first.
5. **Review AI actions**: Always check what the AI is doing before approving tool calls.
