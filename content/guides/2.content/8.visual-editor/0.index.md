title: Visual Editor
description: The Directus Visual Editor module allows you to visually edit the content of your website directly in-place.

Making use of the Visual Editor requires some effort on the part of frontend developers through two separate but related aspects. These are the [Frontend Package](/guides/content/visual-editor/frontend-package), and the [Studio Module](/guides/content/visual-editor/studio-module) built into Directus.

The package sets up the connection between your website and your Directus instance. The studio module is then used to render your website within the Directus studio, make changes in place, and then render those changes as they are made.

## Differences with Live Preview

The Visual Editor behaves similarly to [Live Preview](/guides/content/live-preview), but with a few important differences.

|                    | Live Preview | Visual Editor |
|--------------------|--------------|---------------|
| **Entry Point**    | Item Form | Website rendered in Studio Module |
| **Motivation**     | Users want to view unpublished data | Users want to edit elements on their website directly in place and see changes immediately |
| **Scope**          | Limited to editing/viewing a single item of a collection at a time | Users can navigate through the website freely and edit any linked item on a page without navigating to the applicable collection |
| **Setup**          | Website developers need to implement a preview on their website to ensure that unpublished can be safely viewed | Website developers need to use the Visual Editing package to connect to the Visual Editor and set the `data-directus` attribute on the elements they want to be editable |
