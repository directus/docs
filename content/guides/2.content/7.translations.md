description: Both content and the data studio can be translated into multiple languages.

Localising content in Directus involves using translation strings, which are multilingual key-value pairs that you can use throughout the app. They enable you to translate things like dropdown options, placeholder text, field notes, and more.

**Data Studio Translations**  
This article refers to translating your content in Directus. Many parts of the Data Studio are already translated into multiple languages via community contribution on Crowdin.

![Form to create a translation string](/img/1ca1ec31-2263-4b69-b87b-95449ec98bbd.webp)

To create a translation string, navigate to Settings > Translation Strings and click on :icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle-rounded"} in the page header and a drawer will open.

Add a key and click on "Create New" to open another drawer. Select the language and type in the corresponding translation. Click on :icon{name="material-symbols:check-circle"} to confirm and add the translation.

## Use a Translation String

![Using a translation string on a field](/img/c26df052-5b97-401d-97f8-5c7c7bc29952.webp)

Throughout the settings module, you will notice certain input fields have a :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} icon on them, meaning you have the option assign a translation string.

To assign a translation string, navigate to the input that you'd like to add a translation string to. There are two ways to assign a translation string:

- Click :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} and a dropdown menu with all translation strings will appear.
- Type `$t:translation-string-key` and hit enter.

Choose a translation string key as desired.

**Switching Language**  
There are two ways to change the app language. Administrators can set the project's
[default language](/configuration/translations), while users can choose their own personal language preference.

**Adding New Translation Strings**  
You can also click ":icon{name="material-symbols:add-circle-rounded"} New Translation String" in the :icon{name="material-symbols:translate"} dropdown menu to create a new translation string on the fly.

## Content Translations

With Directus, you can localize your content into several languages using a [translations field](/guides/data-model/relationships) on a given collection.

![Creating a translations field](/img/3097a653-da4f-449a-a5d5-4dcf62da73bd.webp)

Once this field is added to a collection, a few new collections will be created. One being a pre-populated `languages` collection, as well as a hidden `<colletion-name>_translations` collection.

In the "Data Model" section of the settings module, navigate into the `<colletion-name>_translations` collection and add the fields which you'd like to translate.

Now, when [editing an item](/guides/content/editor) of that collection, you'll be able to add translations for those fields.
