**Removing Projects**

Removing a project from the Vercel integration will also permanently delete all deployment history for that project from Directus. This action cannot be undone.

Once configured, your connected Vercel projects will be listed in the Deployment module. From here you can:

- Access deployment controls for each project
- Monitor deployment status and history

**Permissions**

**Admin Access Required (For Now)**
