**Removing Sites**

### View Your Sites

Once set up, your connected Netlify sites appear in the Deployment module. From here you can:
- See all connected sites at a glance
- Access deployment controls for each site
- Track deployment status and history

**Permissions**

**Admin Access Required (For Now)**

At this time, only admin users can trigger deployments and manage Netlify sites. Role-based permissions are planned for an upcoming release, enabling deployment access for specific users and roles.
