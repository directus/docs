Flows enable custom, event-driven data processing and task automation within Directus. Each flow is composed of one trigger, a series of operations, and a data chain that is passed between each step.

## Fields

- **Name (required)** — The displayed name of the Flow.
- **Status** — Sets the flow to active or inactive.
- **Icon** — Adds an icon to help quickly identify the flow.
- **Description** — Sets a brief verbal description of the flow.
- **Color** — Sets a color to help identify the flow.
- **Activity and Logs Tracking** — Selects whether the flow should be tracked in both the [activity log](/guides/auth/accountability) and the flow's logs, only in the activity log, or neither.
- **Folder** — Optionally assign the flow to a folder for organization.

## Organizing Flows

As your project grows, you may have many flows serving different purposes. Directus provides several ways to keep your flows organized.

### Folders and Nesting

Create folders to group related flows together, or nest flows directly under other flows to organize related automations.

**Folders** are pure organizational containers (they don't execute). To create a folder:
1. Navigate to **Settings > Flows**.
2. Click the **Create Folder** button in the header.
3. Enter a name, choose an icon and color, and optionally select a parent.

**Flow nesting** allows you to group a main flow with its related utility flows. For example, nest helper flows under the primary flow they support.

To move a flow into a folder or under another flow:
- **Drag and drop** the flow onto the target in the list.
- Or edit the flow and select a parent from the **Folder** dropdown.

Both folders and flows can be nested to create deep hierarchies. They can be expanded or collapsed using the toggle icon, and their state is preserved across sessions.

### Drag and Drop Sorting

Flows and folders can be reordered by dragging the handle on the left side of each row. The sort order is saved automatically.

### Search

Use the search bar to filter flows by name, status, description, or trigger type. Parent folders and flows remain visible when they contain matching children, preserving the hierarchy context.

## Logs

![Logs from one flow execution. It shows the trigger payload and accountability, and the operation options and payload.](/img/222e9acb-ae30-47be-b59f-0125c10fc58f.webp)

Accessible from the sidebar, logs store information for each flow execution. Each log will display information from
triggers as well as each operation in the flow.

Logs are not a 1:1 mapping to the data chain. Each trigger and operation gets its own dropdown, which stores its
relevant data. Here's what you'll get from each of these:

### Trigger

- **Options** — The values you input when you configured the trigger.
- **Payload** — Displays the data appended under `$trigger`, which includes the data passed into the flow itself.
- **Accountability** — Displays data appended under `$accountability`, which is a breakdown of the permissions and request information of the user that triggered that event.

Note that `$accountability` is not nested under the `$trigger` key. However, it is listed under the trigger in the log
because `$accountability` is generated by the trigger.

### `<OperationKey>`

- **Options** — The values you input when you configured the operation.\
  _(These configuration options are not stored on the data chain)_.
- **Payload** — Displays the data appended under this `<operationKey>`.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="warning"}
**Logs are stored in the database**
Flows configured to tracks will store this information in the database, which may require occasionally deleting.
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Where is `$last`?**
`$last` constantly updates to store the data of the most recently executed operation. Since the log shows the results of the entire flow, `$last` would only be the final
operation in the flow.
