description: Learn how to edit your website’s content in place from within the Directus Studio.

The visual editor module enables content editors to render their website within the Directus Studio, navigate around within the site, and make edits to content in place.

## Configure Visual Editor URLs

Navigate to **Settings → Visual Editor** and add the URL of your website that you want to visually edit. If you have multiple websites, add multiple URLs.

Be sure to enable the Visual Editor from the Modules section of the settings page so it shows up in your project's module bar.

### Version Support in URLs

The URL field supports a `{{$version}}` template variable. When included, the Visual Editor will pass the currently selected version key to your website, enabling version-aware previews.

```
https://your-site.com/preview?version={{$version}}
```

When no version is selected, `{{$version}}` resolves to `main`. The variable can be placed in any part of the URL — query parameters, path segments, subdomains, or hash fragments.

If `{{$version}}` is not included in any URL, version selection will not be available in the toolbar.

**Website Implementation Required**
Adding `{{$version}}` to the URL passes the version key to your website and ensures that edits made in the Visual Editor are saved to the selected version instead of the main item. However, your website must also read this parameter and fetch versioned content using the `version` query parameter on the [items endpoint](/api/items) (e.g. `/items/posts/42?version=draft`). Without this, the website will display main content regardless of the selected version.

**Configure Your Website**
In order to work with Directus, your website’s frontend must first be configured using our publicly available [Frontend Library](/guides/content/visual-editor/frontend-library).
::

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning-rounded" color="warning"}
**Configure Content Security Policy**
Your website will not be able to speak to your Directus instance if you do not set `CONTENT_SECURITY_POLICY_DIRECTIVES__FRAME_SRC="<your-website-base-url>"` within your instances env.<br>

**Configure Cache Auto Purge**
Be sure to set `CACHE_AUTO_PURGE=true` in your Directus instances’s env.<br>

## Editing in the Module

Once your URLs are set up, navigate to the visual editor module by selecting it from module bar. Your first entered URL will render in the module.

Navigating between different added URLs can be done by clicking the dropdown in the top toolbar.

Hovering over an editable item will highlight it within the module.

Click the :icon{name="material-symbols:edit"} icon in the toolbar will highlight all the editable items on the page.

Clicking the :icon{name="material-symbols:edit"} beside an editable element will open an editor in either a drawer, modal, or popover depending on which `mode` was specified in the elements `data-directus` attribute on the frontend.

Once you are done editing your item, click the save button and your website will refresh to show your changes.

## Working with Versions

When a URL includes the `{{$version}}` variable, a version dropdown appears in the toolbar.

### Selecting a Version

The dropdown lists:

- **Main** — the published version (default)
- **Draft** — the global [draft version](/guides/content/content-versioning#working-with-the-draft-version), always available for collections with versioning enabled

If your website URL contains a version key that doesn't match "main" or "draft" (e.g. from a custom query parameter), it will also appear as a dynamic option in the dropdown.

### Version-Aware Editing

When a version other than main is selected:

- **Only items on collections with versioning enabled** will show editable elements. Items on non-versioned collections are hidden from editing.
- **Saving an edit** creates or updates the version for that specific item. If the version doesn't exist yet for the item, it's created automatically on save.
- **Items without content in the selected version** display their main version content as a read-only fallback.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
The version dropdown requires the user to have **read** permission on `directus_versions`. Editing in a version additionally requires **create** or **update** permission on `directus_versions`.

## Permissions

Editable elements are gated by field-level permissions. When visual editing is active, Directus validates each element against the current user's access before making it interactive:

- **Admin users** can edit all elements.
- **Non-admin users** only see editable overlays on fields they have **update** permission for.
- When a **version is selected**, elements are additionally hidden for collections that don't have versioning enabled, and for users without the required `directus_versions` permissions.

Elements that fail permission checks remain completely inert — no overlay, no hover effect, no click handler.
