Content versioning allows teams to create and manage different versions of their content. There are several reasons to
use content versioning, including drafting content without publishing it, and more ways to collaborate effectively.

## Concepts

- **Version**: A snapshot of an item that allows you to safely make changes without affecting the current version or main item. Versions can be promoted to become the new main item.
- **Main**: The published version of your content that is live and visible to users. All new versions are created from the main item.
- **Draft**: a reserved global version that is automatically available when content versioning is enabled. The draft version provides a dedicated workspace for making changes before publishing to main, and appears empty until edits are saved.
- **Promote**: when a version is promoted, it becomes the main item that is displayed to users.
- **Revision**: revisions are individual changes to items made within a version or main item. Directus keeps track of all changes made, so you're able to view the history of modifications and revert to a previous state.

**Using Versions in Live Preview**  
The version field is a dynamic variable can be added to the live preview URL so you can preview a specific version of an item. Check out more about live previews.

## Setting Up Content Versioning

![Content versioning checkbox](/img/26a59b99-55e9-4185-83f3-f8945ace589e.webp)

Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Model**, select the collection that you want to enable content versioning for, and scroll down to the content versioning section. Toggle "Enable Versions" and save your data model.

## Working with the Draft Version

When content versioning is enabled for a collection, a global draft version is automatically available for all items. This reserved version provides a safe workspace for preparing changes before publishing to your live content.

![Content versioning draft](/img/versioning-draft.png)

### Understanding the Draft Version

The draft version:
- Appears automatically in the version list for all items with versioning enabled
- Shows as empty until you make edits
- Transforms from a virtual placeholder to an actual version when you save changes
- Uses "**draft**" as a reserved version key that cannot be used for custom versions
- Can be customized with a different display name, though it defaults to "Draft"

::callout{icon="material-symbols:warning"}
**Backward Compatibility**  
The reserved global "draft" version was introduced in Directus 11.15.0. If you previously had custom versions with the key "draft", they will be preserved with their current names but cannot be deleted. The reserved draft version will coexist with your existing draft versions.
::

### Using Draft in the Visual Editor

The Visual Editor integrates seamlessly with the draft version, allowing you to preview and edit changes in context:

1. **Switch versions** using the dropdown in the Visual Editor header to toggle between "Main" and "Draft"
2. **Edit items** that have content in the active version - items are only directly editable when they exist in the selected version
3. **Preview changes** using the version-aware preview URL before publishing to main
4. **Fallback behavior** - items without content in the selected version display their main version content (read-only)

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Version-Aware Editing**  
When working in a specific version like draft, only items that have content saved in that version will show edit affordances. Other items fall back to displaying their main version content without automatically creating new version entries.

## Creating a New Version

![Creating a new version in the content module](/img/versions-example.png)

Open an item within your versioned collection. At the top of the item view, you will notice a dropdown with the main Content Version displayed as "main". Select "Create Version" and provide a key and a name for the new version. You can then save your new version.

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Version Source**  
All new versions originate from the main item. This implies that the main item acts as the single source of truth for other versions. The draft version is always available and doesn't need to be manually created.
::

## Making Changes to a Version

![Editing a version](/img/versioning_update.png)

Open the item in the newly created version, and make the desired edits to the item's content.

Upon saving the changes, you'll notice that the main item remains unaffected, while the changes are reflected only in the modified version.

## Comparing and Promoting a Version

![Promoting a version, comparing its changes](/img/versions-example-comparison.png)


Promoting a version makes it the main (current) version of your content.

### How to Promote a Version

1. Open the version you want to promote
2. Select the **"Promote Version"** option from the dropdown. 
3. In the comparison modal, review the changes:
   - Fields with differences from the main item are highlighted with color indicators
   - Review each highlighted field to understand what will change
4. Accept or reject individual changes as needed
5. Click **"Promote"** to finalize and make this version the new main item

Once promoted, this version becomes the active content, and the previous main item is preserved in the version history. 

After promoting a version, you can choose to keep or delete the version. For the global draft version, you'll see options to "Discard Edits" or "Keep Edits" instead of "Delete Version" or "Keep Version".

**Programmatically Implement Content Versioning**  
You have the option to integrate Content Versioning through the API. To learn how to accomplish this, please refer to
our [API reference documentation](/api/versions).

## Configuring Visual Editor for Versions

To enable version-aware previewing in the Visual Editor:

1. Navigate to **Settings** > **Data Model** and select your collection
2. In the Visual Editor settings, configure your preview URL to include the `version` variable
3. Example preview URL: `https://your-site.com/preview?item={{id}}&version={{version}}`

The Visual Editor will automatically pass the active version to your preview, allowing you to see draft changes in the context of your actual site layout.


## Revisions and Content Versioning

Under the hood, revisions are stored in the `directus_revisions` collection. In bigger projects this collection
can get large.

### Managing Revision Retention

You can manage revision retention in two ways:

 - **Automatic Retention Policies**: Configure environment variables to automatically control how long revisions are kept. This allows you to balance the need for historical data with storage and performance considerations. See the [Log Retention documentation](../../configuration/logging.md#log-retention) for configuration options.
 - **Manual Cleanup**: Periodically remove some or all data from the `directus_revisions` collection. Note that manual deletion may unintentionally remove content versions that are still in use, so exercise caution when performing bulk deletions.

When implementing retention policies, consider your team's workflow and how far back you may need to revert changes before removing older revisions.

### Viewing and Restoring Revisions

You can view revisions for an item within the right sidebar of the Studio. How many fields were updated in each revision is clarified via the label e.g. **"Updated 2 Fields"**. Clicking on a revision will launch the Content Comparison Modal.

![Revisions Sidebar](/img/revisions.png)

Note that once the comparison modal is open, you can change the revision you want to compare by using the dropdown menu at the top right of the modal.

![Revisions Selector](/img/comparison_revision-selector.png)

Upon selecting a revision, you will see the differences between the current version (indicated on the left) and that revision (indicated on the right). 

![Content Comparison Modal](/img/comparison_revision-diff-indicators.png)

The 'Updated' label indicators demonstrate which fields were updated in that revision, while the change indicators assist in understanding how the selected revision currently compares to the version it is associated with. If the revision is not associated with a version, the comparison will be against the main item.

![Diff Indicators](/img/comparison_revision-diff-indicators-2.png)

When a collapsed group interface contains fields with updates or differences, a diff indicator appears next to the group name.

![Diff Indicator on Collapsed Group](/img/comparison_group-indicator.png)

When expanded, diff indicators are displayed next to each field in the group that has updates or differences.

![Diff Indicators on Expanded Group](/img/comparison_group-indicator-expanded.png)
This can be mitigated by periodically removing some or all data in this collection. Note that this could
unintentionally remove some content versions.

## API Response Structure

When working with content versioning through the API, it's important to understand how items and their versions are represented differently.

### Standard Item Response

When fetching items from a collection endpoint `/items/{collection}`, you receive the main version data:
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Lion King",
      "author": 1,
      "release_date": "2025-10-01T12:00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Version Response

When fetching versions from the `/versions/{version}` endpoint, each version contains metadata and a delta object that shows the changes made in that version:
```json
{
    "data": {
        "id": "0e0a8110-3cab-4bfb-93d5-17662588d0d4",
        "key": "version-x",
        "name": "version-x",
        "collection": "books",
        "item": "1",
        "hash": "3284251037784c38c5bada022e579d3a484b4a09",
        "date_created": "2025-10-14T08:58:21.279Z",
        "date_updated": "2025-10-14T09:02:55.682Z",
        "user_created": "ec5f6af5-b113-4b0a-9792-67596a547fd8",
        "user_updated": "ec5f6af5-b113-4b0a-9792-67596a547fd8",
        "delta": {
            "id": "1",
            "author": 2,
            "release_date": "2025-10-05T12:00:00"
        }
    }
}
```

The `delta` object contains only the modified fields, making it easy to see exactly what changed in each version compared to the state of main at the time that version was created.
