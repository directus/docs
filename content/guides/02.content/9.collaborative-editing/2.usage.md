This guide covers the essential features you'll use when collaborating on content in real-time.


## Visual Indicators

When you open any item for editing, you'll see collaboration indicators:

- **User avatar stack** - appears in the header to show how the users currently editing the item
- **User avatars** appear next to fields when someone is editing them
- **Field locking** prevents you from editing fields others are actively using
- **Real-time updates** show changes as they happen

## Basic Usage

1. Open any collection item
2. Start editing - your avatar appears for others to see
3. Other users' avatars show which fields they're working on
4. Locked fields automatically unlock when users move away

## Where It Works

Collaborative editing works across:

- **All collections and items**

## Summary

Collaborative editing happens automatically once the extension is enabled. Multiple users can work on the same content simultaneously without conflicts, with clear visual indicators showing who's working where.
