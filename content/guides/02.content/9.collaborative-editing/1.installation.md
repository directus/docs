description: Learn how to install and configure the Collaborative Editing extension to enable real-time collaboration in your Directus project.
---

This guide covers installing the Collaborative Editing extension either manually or from the Directus Marketplace, configuring collaboration settings, and verifying that real-time collaboration is working in your project.

## Before You Start

Before installing the Collaborative Editing extension, ensure you have:

- **Admin access** to your Directus project
- **Directus 11.8.0 or higher** installed and running
- **WebSocket support** enabled in your Directus configuration
- **Extension installation permissions** on your server or hosting environment

**WebSocket Configuration**
<br />
Collaborative editing requires WebSocket support to function. Make sure your Directus instance has WebSockets properly configured according to the [official WebSocket documentation](https://directus.io/docs/configuration/realtime).

### From Directus Marketplace

1. Navigate to your Directus admin panel

**Important Note: While this extension is developed by our Directus core team, it is not sandboxed.**
<br />
If you want to install from the Directus Marketplace, set the `MARKETPLACE_TRUST` variable in your [Directus Configuration](https://directus.io/docs/configuration/extensions#marketplace) to `all`. Be extremely careful about installing any extensions from untrusted sources. [Learn more about extensions and the sandboxed extensions](https://directus.io/docs/guides/extensions/api-extensions/sandbox).

### Manual Installation

For other installation methods:

```bash
npm install @directus-labs/collaborative-editing
```

Then follow the [Official Guide](https://directus.io/docs/self-hosting/including-extensions) for manual extension installation.

### Self-Hosted Docker Installation

For self-hosted Directus projects using Docker, you need to build a custom image to include the extension:

#### 1. Modify Docker Compose File

In your `docker-compose.yml` file, delete the `image` property and add a `build` section to the `directus` service:

```yaml
services:
  directus:
    build:
      context: ./
    # Remove the image: directus/directus:latest line
```

#### 2. Create a Dockerfile

At the root of your project, create a file called `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM directus/directus:latest

USER root
RUN corepack enable
USER node

RUN pnpm install @directus-labs/collaborative-editing
# You can add any other extensions you want here as well
```

#### 3. Build and Run

Build your Docker image and start the container:

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up
```

After starting the container, navigate to your Directus admin panel. Go to **Settings → Extensions** to verify that "Collaborative Editing" appears in the extensions list.

### Enterprise Installation

For Directus Enterprise customers with custom extensions repositories:

1. **Pull the Extension**: Clone the extension from the [Directus Labs repository](https://github.com/directus-labs/extensions)
2. **Build Locally**: Build the extension following your standard development process
3. **Add to Extensions Repository**: Place the built extension in your extensions repository directory
4. **Create Pull Request**: Follow your organization's review and merge process
5. **Wait for Deployment**: After merging, the extension will be available in your project within 5-15 minutes

If you're unfamiliar with this process, contact the Directus support team for assistance.


## Configuration

### Enable the Module

After installation, you need to enable the Collaborative Editing module:

1. **Navigate to Module Settings**:
   - Go to **Settings → Module Bar**
   - Find "Collaborative Editing" in the list
   - Toggle it **ON** to enable the module
   - Don't forget to **Save** the settings

2. **Access the Module**:
   - The Collaborative Editing icon will now appear in your module bar
   - Click the icon to access the configuration settings

### Configure Collaboration Settings

When you first access the Collaborative Editing module, you'll see a message that settings are missing. Click **Create Collaborative Editing Settings** to automatically generate the necessary configuration:

#### Global Approach (Recommended)

By default, collaborative editing is enabled globally across your entire Directus project:

- **Enable Collaborative Editing Globally** - Toggle to enable collaboration across all collections, file library, and user directory
- This is the easiest method and works immediately
- Provides collaboration everywhere without additional setup

#### Selective Approach

For more granular control, you can disable global collaboration and enable it per collection:

1. **Disable Global Setting**:
   - Turn off "Enable Collaborative Editing Globally" in the module settings

2. **Enable Per Collection**:
   - Navigate to your collection's **Data Model** settings
   - Click **Create Field**
   - Search for and add the **"Collaboration"** interface
   - Set the field type as **Alias** with **Presentation** display
   - Save the field configuration

This approach works well for projects with sensitive data where you need more granular control over which collections support collaboration.

## Verification

To verify the installation is working correctly:

1. **Check Extensions**: Navigate to **Settings → Extensions** and confirm "Collaborative Editing" is listed
2. **Enable Module**: Go to **Settings → Module Bar**, check the Collaborative Editing box, and save
3. **Create Settings**: Access the Collaborative Editing module and click **Create Collaborative Editing Settings**
4. **Test Collaboration**: Open any collection item and look for the small collaboration icon showing your user avatar
5. **Multi-User Test**: Have another user open the same item - you should see their avatar appear when they edit different fields

## Troubleshooting

### Potential Issues

**Module Not Appearing**
- Verify the extension is properly installed
- Check that the module is enabled in Settings → Module Bar
- Restart your Directus project if needed

**WebSocket Connection Failed**
- Confirm `WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED=true` is set in your environment
- Check your server configuration supports WebSocket connections
- Verify firewall settings allow WebSocket traffic

**Settings Not Saving**
- Ensure your user has admin permissions
- Check the browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify database write permissions

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues.

```bash
REALTIME_LOGS_ENABLED=true
```

This will provide detailed information about WebSocket connections, user events, and collaboration activities in your Directus logs.
