This guide covers the configuration settings for the Collaborative Editing feature.

## Configuration

::callout{icon="material-symbols:info-outline"}
**Enabling Collaborative Editing**
If WebSockets are active on your Directus instance, then enabling Collaborative Editing is as simple as checking it on your Directus settings. It will be automatically active across all collections in your instance. For detailed configuration options and environment variables, please refer to the [Collaborative Editing Configuration](/configuration/realtime#collaborative-editing) documentation.

## Verification

To verify that collaborative editing is working correctly:

1. **Verify WebSockets**: Ensure your Directus instance has WebSockets enabled (`WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED=true`).
2. **Verify Project Settings**: Ensure your Directus instance has Collaborative Editing enabled in Project Settings.
3. **Test Collaboration**: Open any collection item and look for the collaboration indicators (avatars are shown in the header).
4. **Multi-User Test**: Have another user open the same item and you should see their avatar appear.

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Failed

- Confirm `WEBSOCKETS_ENABLED=true` is set.
- Check that your server/proxy supports WebSocket connections.
- Verify firewall settings allow WebSocket traffic.

### Redis Issues (Multi-Instance)

- Ensure all instances are connected to the same Redis server.
- Verify the `WEBSOCKETS_COLLAB_STORE_NAMESPACE` if sharing a Redis instance with other applications (default is `collab`).

### Debug Logging

Enable debug logging to troubleshoot issues.

```bash
LOG_LEVEL="debug"
```

This will provide detailed information about WebSocket connections, user events, and collaboration activities in your Directus logs.
