Connect your Directus instance with Clay to automate data enrichment, sync content, and build powerful workflows between your content platform and Clay's data enrichment tools.

## Before You Start

### Set Up Your Directus Project

You'll need a Directus project with:

- Collections set up with the data you want to work with
- Proper permissions configured for the operations you plan to use
- API access enabled and a valid API token

If you don't already have a Directus project, the easiest way to get started is with our [managed Directus Cloud service](https://directus.cloud).

### Set Up Clay

Make sure you have a Clay account and are familiar with:

- Creating enrichment columns
- Basic Clay workflow concepts
- How to search for and use templates
